# Tanga Redesign
This is a redesign I did for Tanga.com in my free time. Over the past few years, Tanga has evolved quite a bit as a company. In 2017, I led an 8 month long project at Tanga to optimize the site for all devices (desktop, tablets, and mobile) in order to keep up with the shifting landscape of digital commerce, as customers have started to shop on mobile more often than desktop devices. During this time I also sought to improve the user experience as a whole and make our branding as consistent as possible, along with cleaning up the infrastructure of the front-end (which was a mess).

After the changes, it became obvious that while Tanga has grown and evolved significantly in terms of company strategy, technology, user experience, and design thinking, the branding itself has not been refreshed to accurately reflect that, and the website still feels out-of-date and inconsistent with the true personality of Tanga. The old technologies, slow performance, and outdated look and feel of the website detract from the user experience and make shopping at Tanga not as fun, exciting, and smooth as it should be.

Knowing this, I took matters into my own hands and felt the need to redesign Tanga from scratch entirely, and overhaul the whole site from the ground up, in terms of branding, design, and development.

## Goals

1. Refresh the look and feel of Tanga to reflect the true nature of the brand in 2018.
2. Decouple the front-end from the back-end infrastructure, and use the latest technologies and best practices.
3. Make Tanga a full-screen, fully responsive, progressive web app.
4. Create a new Design System for Tanga that will unify the experience and branding on both the web and in email.

## Technology
This was built using React, React Router 4, Sass, and TailwindCSS. This follows the user experience that currently exists on Tanga, but is improved and updated to match the new look and feel.
